        <h3>Assignment Introduction and Summary</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="overview">
        <p>
          This assignment, for CSCI 1300 at Brown University, instructed us to
          find, observe, and interview people using a public interface. Once we
          had gathered observations and responses to our questions, we were to
          create two personas based on our findings that represented two
          different types of users that would be using our targeted interface.
          We also were instructed to create a storyboard for one of our personas
          to illustrate their interaction in more detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose a shared microwave in my apartment building as my interface.
          The microwave was generally pretty standard, although it had a lot of
          buttons and features on its control panel. My research identified two
          broad personas among the users: one persona that wanted to get their
          food cooked with little effort, and another who valued cooking their
          food well. The interface generally worked well for the first type of
          user, since they could start the microwave with just one click, but
          the second type of user found the more advanced functionality unclear
          and hard to use.

        <h3>Interface</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="interface-desc">
        <ul>
          <li>
            This interface is trying to allow users to cook food quickly and
            efficiently, to whatever specification they desire.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fastest way to start the microwave is by just clicking one of
            the numbers 1-5, which activates the express cook and runs the
            microwave for the specified number of minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            To set the cook time manually, the user must press the cook time
            button and then input the desired number of minutes and seconds on
            the keypad, at which point they press start.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user can start the timer for 30 seconds or add 30 seconds to the
            cook time by pressing the "Add 30 Sec" button, and can stop the
            cooking by pressing Cancel or by opening the door
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting the power level can only be done while the microwave is
            running, or while the cook time mode is selected
          </li>
          <li>
            Trying to set the power level at the wrong time causes a
            lower-pitched beep and leads the display to slowly cycle through the
            message "Power level may not be changed at this time"
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>What types of food do you normally cook in the microwave?</li>
          <li>How long do normally you cook your food for?</li>
          <li>What features on the microwave have you used?</li>
          <li>
            Are you more focused on getting things heated quickly, or getting
            things to exactly the right temperature?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you find that it is easy to do what you want on the interface?

          <h3>Responses</h3>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respondents used the microwave in varying ways: 2 respondents saying
            they mostly reheated leftovers or prepared ingredients for cooking
            (water, butter, frozen ingredients), while the third said they
            mostly cooked pre-made frozen meals.
          </li>
          <li>
            One respondent had grown up in Europe and primarily used microwaves
            with a knob to set the timer rather than a keypad, and did not feel
            as familiar with the interface as the others did.
          </li>
          <li>
            One respondent was confused by the extra buttons and features and
            wished for a simpler interface with just the timer and power level.
          </li>
          <li>
            While most respondents just used the Express Cook settings and
            didnâ€™t particularly care if their food came out a little overcooked,
            one respondent was more particular with timings, aiming to cook
            their food to the perfect heat level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The more particular respondent found setting the timer beyond the
            express settings to be unintuitive, and found changing the microwave
            power level to be difficult as well.

        <ul>
          <li>Many users just used quick time select or add 30 seconds</li>
          <li>
            One user was trying to melt butter for 20 seconds, but was
            frustrated since they initially tried to click the 2 button, which
            added 2 minutes to the timer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users seemed confused by the multitude of extra functions with
            uncertain functionality; one user tried to use the defrost function
            and found the menu unintuitive, while another struggled to set the
            power level

              Busy Beth primarily reheats leftovers and wants to get her food
              cooked as with as little effort as possible, even if there is
              imperfect heating.
            </p>
            <p>
              She does not face many interface problems and is able to get what
              she wants done quickly by using the Express Cook feature, although
              she finds all the extra buttons a bit overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              2 of the users I interviewed were like Beth in that they just
              wanted their food heated quickly, so they just the Express Cook
              feature with little customization.

            <p>
              Precise Peter is a perfectionist who doesn't like his food
              overcooked. He prefers spending a few seconds to set the timer
              manually and likes to adjust the power levels to get the perfect
              heat level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Peter was frustrated, since he initially tried to set the timer
              without clicking the "Cook Time" button, which ran the Express
              Cook by default and automatically started the microwave on full
              power. He also found that setting the power level was confusing,
              since the button wouldn't work unless the timer was set.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Peter, one of my respondents was more precise with their
              cooking and had similar problems with the interface.
